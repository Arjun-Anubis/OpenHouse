We have all become accustomed to this new situation which has spread over us as fast as the nachos disappear from the bowl that I told no one to touch. In all the mess of lockdown and social distancing, we all may be happy to have an excuse to stay away from that eccentric neighbor who never wears perfume, but this seemingly unclimbable wall has also kept us away from friends and the people we actually care about. Lets get to know how these new changes have affected the younger generation by asking the important questions questions:

- How has this pandemic affected the lives of schoolgoing children?
- What changes will we see next?
- Why didn't I get the purple nachos instead?

Clearly, one of those questions is the most puzzling of the bunch. To answer the other 2. We have with us some High schoolers from shikshantar school south city 1 gurgaon who have agreed to help us understand how this pandemic has put a twist on the already stressful life of a 9th grader.
