I think thanks to Whatsapp and other apps ive been able to keep in touch with my peers and I have become closer to a few people I did not know that well but I have also stopped talking to many people who do not have a phone. I do feel like everyone had a hard time connecting with each other when the lockdown just started,but after some time it has become quite simple for us and we've all gotten closer to people we probably would not have if corona virus had not happened
