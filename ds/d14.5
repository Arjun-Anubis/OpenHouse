I have always felt like one of the best things about interacting with other people is the introduction to different perspectives and views. I have always tried to be open-minded because if you dont talk to people its very easy to start thinking that your opinion is always right and you will end up with a constricted point of view of the world and so its really important to listen to other peoples opinions as well and consider their takes and thoughts. sometimes it was a little difficult to pay a lot of attention to someone elses perspective but when I actually did I realised that there are a lot of things that others can think of that I cannot as everyone has different levels of imagination and different experiences and everyone has a different thought process so its important to take some pieces from all of the sources to complete the puzzle. so yeah I have mostly found dealing with different perspectives pretty comfortable though i will try and be even more open minded in the future and I think everyone else should too
