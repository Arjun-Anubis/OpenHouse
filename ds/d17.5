No, I would say everyone around me has also been very considerate about my views on things and they have always let me voice my opinion and have respected it. Sometimes when people have conflicting opinions they might try to undermine each others views in order to prove that their view is right but thats normal and everyone does that but I never felt like my opinion was ignored or was not acknowledged.
