Bonds before the pandemic were very different, I didn't know the significance of the 5-10 year old relationships I had with my friends. I just talked to them, played games, nothing more than that.  When Corona locked us in our homes, I missed every friend I had, I understood the value of each and every friend I had, and I guess they did too. Honestly, I might have forgotten about a few friends but with most, Iâ€™ve learnt the fact that keeping the strongest bond with them is one of my utmost priorities because these are the people that can really make me happy and enjoy life.
